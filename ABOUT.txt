The Game Grash

-------------------------------

License: "All rights reserved."

The entire game was created by Eliah Roos (aka BlackBlocky),
including the code, graphics, music, UI design, level design, and more.

The music was made using the tool BeepBox, with occasional additional editing done in Audacity.
The textures were created with the help of Aseprite.

The icon and splash screen were created using deepai.org.
The voice in the tutorial level was also generated with DeepAI, and later edited using voicechanger.io.

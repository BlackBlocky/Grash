# Grash, a rhythm game
## A Game that combines [Osu](https://osu.ppy.sh) and [Geometry Dash](https://store.steampowered.com/app/322170/Geometry_Dash/).

### Game Concept
The core mechanic of **Grash** is the combination of the Levels from Geometry Dash and the Rhythm-Part from Osu.
Levels are designed so that players must constantly dodge various obstacles in order to avoid losing.  
To succeed, players must hit the arrow keys in time with the music—the more accurate the timing, the better the score.

### Technology and Frameworks
The game is written in [Java](https://www.java.com/en/) and uses the [JavaFX](https://openjfx.io) library.  
The architecture of the game is based on an event bus system. Every object in the game will have its own state and execute different code depending on that state.

### The Level editor
In order to create new Levels for the Game, a Level-Editor was needed.
The Editor in its current state is okay, but it can still have a lot of improvements.
